# Hey there, I'm Sondos!

Welcome to my GitHub profile:).

I'm an undergraduate student passionate about Artificial Intelligence and currently focused on building my skills through hands-on projects and experimentation. I'm especially interested in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and how they can be used to build smarter, more personalized tutoring systems and educational tools.
