Hi, I’m Sondos 💗
I’m a passionate AI and Data Science student who decided to have a fresh start on GitHub (yes, I recreated my account).
Hopefully, by the time anyone reads this, my profile will have good projects on it or show significant progress!.

🚀 I'm interested in AI, machine learning, data engineering, and of course mathematics.

🌱 I’m currently diving into NLP, strengthening my foundation in mathematics, and mastering the art of “learning how to learn.”
There’s so much more on my list to explore, and I’m always learning and growing.

💡 I'm looking to collaborate on AI-powered applications and data science projects that solve real-world problems.
